            <br>
            <p id="famous5">
                Five Get into Trouble is the eighth novel in The Famous Five series by Enid Blyton. It was first published in 1949. <br> <br> The five are allowed to go on a cycling holiday after a lot of argument. While there, they meet a boy called Richard Kent. His father is rich but fierce and once had a bodyguard named Rooky, whom Richard didn't like and made a false plan to kick him out of their life. Richard asks the Five to let him share the trip, and promises to go to his aunt's house at the end of the day, if his mother gives him permission. They agree, and Richard joins them. However Richard had not asked permission, and when he arrives to his aunt's he finds her away. As he leaves, he gets chased by a car driven by Rooky. When he reaches the Five he reveals the truth.<br> <br> Meanwhile, Rooky's associates mistake Dick for Richard and kidnap him. The others and Richard trace Dick to Owl's Dene, and on the way they see a man throwing clothes down a well. When they arrive they sneak into the house but are caught and imprisoned themselves. Julian escapes in the house and finds a secret room with a man sleeping in it. The next morning Rooky sees Dick and explains his associate's mistake. At this point the Five are nearly free, but Richard is recognised and they are held prisoner again. When one of the gang members plans to go out, the Five plan that one of them will hide in the boot of his car. Richard proves his worth by volunteering to do this. He escapes in the boot and goes to the police. When the police arrive, Julian shows them the secret room which contains a wanted person! Richard is taken home where his worried parents waiting for him and the Five join them for a treat from Richard's parents for helping him. It all ends with happy faces. <br> <br>

            <p id="apjkalam">
                My biggest inspiration is Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam. He is one of India's most renowned and respected scientist. Sir Abdul Kalam has a huge contribution to India's Space Development and missions. I aim to be a scientist in ISRO. He is an inspiration for me because of his selfless nature and interest in India's advancement. I hope to do something for my country so that the whole world looks at India with even more admiration, just like the way Sir APJ wishes it to be. My other inspirations are of course my parents and elder brother, without whom I may not even be able to aim of such things! </p> <br> <br> <br> <br>
